ts-node-dev restarts a target Node.js process when any of the required files change. However, it shares the Typescript compilation process between restarts, which can significantly increase the restart speed.

Let's briefly break down the options that ts-node-dev takes:

    --respawn: Keep watching for changes after the script has exited.

    --pretty: Use pretty diagnostic formatter (TS_NODE_PRETTY).

    --transpile-only: Use TypeScript's faster transpileModule (TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY).

    src/index.ts: This is the application's entry file.
